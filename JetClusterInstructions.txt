loop over all particle pairs?
     - method to identify pairs?
     - maybe j = i + 1
{
	calculate Dij = min( pow ( pythia.event[i].pT, -2 ) , pow (pythia.event[j].pT, -2 ) );
	multiply by difference in azimuthal angles square and difference in the pseudorapidities squared
	... * ( ([i].phi()-[j].phi())^2 + ([i].eta()-[j].eta())^2)
	divide by R squared which is set before, usually to = 0.4


for every individual particle...

    calculate Dib = [i].pT()^-2
    min( Dij, Dib)
    if ( min == Dij)
    {
	add 4 momenta... [i].px() + [j].px() and so on and create new particle
	remove [i] and [j] from the list and add new particle to end???
    }
    else if ( min == Dib )
    {
	call it a jet???
	remove [i] from particle list and add to jet list ( where and what is jet list)
	stop when no more particles
	
		  - the min function finds the smaller of the 2 values
		  - you are basically figuring out which particle has a smaller transverse momentum
